# CSBP441_ASG1_Logo_G14
This is Assignment 1 for our Group (G14) for the Applied Computer Vision class in UAEU.

# Overview
In this project, we used Python and OpenCV to recreate Logo 14, inspired by the Louis Vuitton (LV) style design. We created a blank white canvas and added text elements using different OpenCV fonts. Specifically, the italic “L” and the standard “V” were drawn with large font sizes to mimic the overlapping LV monogram. Below these letters, we placed the full brand name “LOUIS VUITTON” using a smaller plain font for emphasis. The output was displayed directly in Google Colab using cv2_imshow and also saved as an image file. This implementation demonstrates the use of OpenCV’s text-rendering functions (cv2.putText) to design a structured and professional-looking logo.
